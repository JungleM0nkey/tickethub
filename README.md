![alt text](https://i.imgur.com/AahgolP.png "Home landing page preview")

Key Features:
1. User Creation and Management
2. Ability to link users with o365
3. Ticket sorting by date, completion status or a custom user made sort
4. Ticket editing, deletion and assignment to other users


Setup:
1. Install dependencies
2. Configure your SECRET_KEY environment variable
3. To launch the server use the command: flask
4. Login as user: Admin password: moose

The project has a few missing features from the current repo such as the ability to scrape a user email inbox if its linked to o365 and assign tickets by custom keyword found in those emails.
This along with mobile scaling and user metric reporting is to be added in the near future.
Please note: The interface at the moment works best on monitors with a resolution of 720p and above.
